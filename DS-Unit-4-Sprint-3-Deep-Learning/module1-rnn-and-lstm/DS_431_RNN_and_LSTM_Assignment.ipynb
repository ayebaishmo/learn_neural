my love excuse the slow offence\\r of my dull bearer when from thee i speed\\r from where thou art why should i haste me thence\\r o what excuse will my poor beast then find\\r then should i spur though mounted on the wind\\r then can no horse with my desire keep pace\\r therefore desire of perfectst love being made\\r shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race\\r but love for love thus shall excuse my jade\\r since from thee going he went wilfulslow\\r towards thee ill run and give him leave to go\\r can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure\\r the which he will not every hour

lest your true love may seem false in this\\r that you for love speak well of me untrue\\r and live no more to shame nor me nor you\\r for i am shamed by that which i bring forth\\r and so should you to love things nothing worth\\r that time of year thou mayst in me behold\\r when yellow leaves or none or few do hang\\r upon those boughs which shake against the cold\\r bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang\\r in me thou seest the twilight of such day\\r which by and by black night doth take away\\r deaths second self that seals up all in rest\\r in me thou seest the glowing of such fire\\r that on the ashes of his youth doth lie\\r as the deathbed whereon it must expire\\r consumd with that which it was nourishd by\\r this thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong\\r to love that well which thou must leave ere long\\r my life hath in this line some interest\\r which for memorial still with thee shall stay\\r when thou reviewest this thou dost review\\r the earth can have but earth which is his due\\r my spirit is thine the better part of me\\r so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life\\r the coward conquest of a wretchs knife\\r the worth of that is that which it contains\\r and that is this and this with thee remains\\r so are you to my thoughts as food to life\\r or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground\\r and for the peace of you i hold such strife\\r as twixt a miser and his wealth is found\\r doubting the filching age will steal his treasure\\r then betterd that the world may see my pleasure\\r sometime all full with feasting on your sight\\r save what is had or must from you be took\\r thus do i pine and surfeit day by day\\r to newfound methods and to compounds strange\\r why write i still all one ever the same\\r that every word doth almost tell my name\\r showing their birth and where they did proceed\\r o know sweet love i always write of you\\r so all my best is dressing old words new\\r for as the sun is daily new and old\\r so is my love still telling what is told\\r thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear\\r thy dial how thy precious minutes waste\\r these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear\\r and of this book this learning mayst thou taste\\r the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show\\r of mouthed graves will give thee memory\\r thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know\\r commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find\\r those children nursed deliverd from thy brain\\r these offices so oft as thou wilt look\\r shall profit thee and much enrich thy book\\r and found such fair assistance in my verse\\r thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing\\r have added feathers to the learneds wing\\r yet be most proud of that which i compile\\r whose influence is thine and born of thee\\r in others works thou dost but mend the style\\r and arts with thy sweet graces graced be\\r but thou art all my art and dost advance\\r as high as learning my rude ignorance\\r my verse alone had all thy gentle grace\\r but now my gracious numbers are decayd\\r and my sick muse doth give an other place\\r i grant sweet love thy lovely argument\\r he robs thee of and pays it thee again\\r he lends thee virtue and he stole that word\\r from thy behaviour beauty doth he give\\r and found it in thy cheek he can afford\\r no praise to thee but what in thee doth live\\r then thank him not for that which he doth say\\r since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay\\r knowing a better spirit doth use your name\\r and in the praise thereof spends all his might\\r to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame\\r but since your worth wide as the ocean is\\r the humble as the proudest sail doth bear\\r on your broad main doth wilfully appear\\r your shallowest help will hold me up afloat\\r whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride\\r or being wrackd i am a worthless boat\\r he of tall building and of goodly pride\\r then if he thrive and i be cast away\\r the worst was this my love was my decay\\r or you survive when i in earth am rotten\\r from hence your memory death cannot take\\r although in me each part will be forgotten\\r your name from hence immortal life shall have\\r though i once gone to all the world must die\\r the earth can yield me but a common grave\\r when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie\\r which eyes not yet created shall oerread\\r and tongues to be your being shall rehearse\\r when all the breathers of this world are dead\\r you still shall live such virtue hath my pen\\r where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men\\r i grant thou wert not married to my muse\\r and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook\\r of their fair subject blessing every book\\r thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue\\r finding thy worth a limit past my praise\\r some fresher stamp of the timebettering days\\r and do so love yet when they have devisd\\r what strained touches rhetoric can lend\\r in true plain words by thy truetelling friend\\r and their gross painting might be better usd\\r where cheeks need blood in thee it is abusd\\r and therefore to your fair no painting set\\r i found or thought i found you did exceed\\r and therefore have i slept in your report\\r that you yourself being extant well might show\\r how far a modern quill doth come too short\\r speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow\\r which shall be most my glory being dumb\\r when others would give life and bring a tomb\\r there lives more life in one of your fair eyes\\r than both your poets can in praise devise\\r who is it that says most which can say more\\r than this rich praise that you alone are you\\r which should example where your equal grew\\r that to his subject lends not some small glory\\r but he that writes of you if he can tell\\r that you are you so dignifies his story\\r not making worse what nature made so clear\\r and such a counterpart shall fame his wit\\r you to your beauteous blessings add a curse\\r being fond on praise which makes your praises worse\\r my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still\\r while comments of your praise richly compild\\r reserve their character with golden quill\\r and precious phrase by all the muses fild\\r i think good thoughts whilst others write good words\\r and like unlettered clerk still cry amen\\r hearing you praised i say tis so tis true\\r and to the most of praise add something more\\r but that is in my thought whose love to you\\r though words come hindmost holds his rank before\\r then others for the breath of words respect\\r me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect\\r was it the proud full sail of his great verse\\r bound for the prize of all too precious you\\r that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse\\r making their tomb the womb wherein they grew\\r was it his spirit by spirits taught to write\\r above a mortal pitch that struck me dead\\r no neither he nor his compeers by night\\r which nightly gulls him with intelligence\\r but when your countenance filld up his line\\r then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine\\r farewell thou art too dear for my possessing\\r and like enough thou knowst thy estimate\\r the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing\\r for how do i hold thee but by thy granting\\r and for that riches where is my deserving\\r the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting\\r and so my patent back again is swerving\\r thyself thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing\\r or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking\\r so thy great gift upon misprision growing\\r comes home again on better judgement making\\r thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter\\r in sleep a king but waking no such matter\\r when thou shalt be disposd to set me light\\r upon thy side against myself ill fight\\r and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn\\r with mine own weakness being best acquainted\\r of faults conceald wherein i am attainted\\r that thou in losing me shalt win much glory\\r for bending all my loving thoughts on thee\\r such is my love to thee i so belong\\r that for thy right myself will bear all wrong\\r say that thou didst forsake me for some fault\\r speak of my lameness and i straight will halt\\r thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill\\r as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will\\r i will acquaintance strangle and look strange\\r be absent from thy walks and in my tongue\\r thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell\\r lest i too much profane should do it wrong\\r for thee against my self ill vow debate\\r for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate\\r then hate me when thou wilt if ever now\\r now while the world is bent my deeds to cross\\r join with the spite of fortune make me bow\\r ah do not when my heart hath scapd this sorrow\\r come in the rearward of a conquerd woe\\r if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last\\r when other petty griefs have done their spite\\r at first the very worst of fortunes might\\r and other strains of woe which now seem woe\\r compard with loss of thee will not seem so\\r some glory in their birth some in their skill\\r some in their wealth some in their bodys force\\r some in their garments though newfangled ill\\r some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse\\r and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure\\r but these particulars are not my measure\\r thy love is better than high birth to me\\r richer than wealth prouder than garments costs\\r of more delight than hawks and horses be\\r and having thee of all mens pride i boast\\r wretched in this alone that thou mayst take\\r all this away and me most wretched make\\r and life no longer than thy love will stay\\r then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs\\r when in the least of them my life hath end\\r than that which on thy humour doth depend\\r thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind\\r since that my life on thy revolt doth lie\\r but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot\\r thou mayst be false and yet i know it not\\r so shall i live supposing thou art true\\r may still seem love to me though alterd new\\r thy looks with me thy heart in other place\\r for there can live no hatred in thine eye\\r therefore in that i cannot know thy change\\r in manys looks the false hearts history\\r is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange\\r that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell\\r whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be\\r thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell\\r how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow\\r if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show\\r they that have power to hurt and will do none\\r that do not do the thing they most do show\\r who moving others are themselves as stone\\r they rightly do inherit heavens graces\\r and husband natures riches from expense\\r they are the lords and owners of their faces\\r others but stewards of their excellence\\r the summers flower is to the summer sweet\\r but if that flower with base infection meet\\r for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds\\r lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds\\r how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame\\r which like a canker in the fragrant rose\\r doth spot the beauty of thy budding name\\r o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose\\r that tongue that tells the story of thy days\\r making lascivious comments on thy sport\\r cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise\\r which for their habitation chose out thee\\r where beautys veil doth cover every blot\\r and all things turns to fair that eyes can see\\r take heed dear heart of this large privilege\\r the hardest knife illusd doth lose his edge\\r some say thy fault is youth some wantonness\\r some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport\\r both grace and faults are lovd of more and less\\r thou makst faults graces that to thee resort\\r so are those errors that in thee are seen\\r to truths translated and for true things deemd\\r how many lambs might the stern wolf betray\\r if like a lamb he could his looks translate\\r if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state\\r but do not so i love thee in such sort\\r as thou being mine mine is thy good report\\r from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year\\r what freezings have i felt what dark days seen\\r what old decembers bareness everywhere\\r and yet this time removed was summers time\\r the teeming autumn big with rich increase\\r like widowd wombs after their lords decease\\r but hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit\\r for summer and his pleasures wait on thee\\r and thou away the very birds are mute\\r or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer\\r that leaves look pale dreading the winters near\\r from you have i been absent in the spring\\r when proudpied april dressd in all his trim\\r hath put a spirit of youth in every thing\\r that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him\\r yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell\\r of different flowers in odour and in hue\\r or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew\\r nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose\\r they were but sweet but figures of delight\\r drawn after you you pattern of all those\\r yet seemd it winter still and you away\\r as with your shadow i with these did play\\r sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells\\r if not from my loves breath the purple pride\\r which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells\\r in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd\\r and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair\\r the roses fearfully on thorns did stand\\r one blushing shame another white despair\\r a third nor red nor white had stoln of both\\r and to his robbery had annexd thy breath\\r but for his theft in pride of all his growth\\r more flowers i noted yet i none could see\\r but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee\\r where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long\\r to speak of that which gives thee all thy might\\r spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song\\r darkening thy power to lend base subjects light\\r return forgetful muse and straight redeem\\r sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem\\r and gives thy pen both skill and argument\\r rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey\\r and make times spoils despised every where\\r give my love fame faster than time wastes life\\r so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife\\r for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyd\\r both truth and beauty on my love depends\\r so dost thou too and therein dignified\\r make answer muse wilt thou not haply say\\r truth needs no colour with his colour fixd\\r beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay\\r because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb\\r excuse not silence so fort lies in thee\\r then do thy office muse i teach thee how\\r to make him seem long hence as he shows now\\r my love is strengthend though more weak in seeming\\r i love not less though less the show appear\\r that love is merchandizd whose rich esteeming\\r the owners tongue doth publish every where\\r our love was new and then but in the spring\\r when i was wont to greet it with my lays\\r as philomel in summers front doth sing\\r and stops her pipe in growth of riper days\\r not that the summer is less pleasant now\\r than when her mournful hymns did hush the night\\r but that wild music burthens every bough\\r and sweets grown common lose their dear delight\\r therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue\\r because i would not dull you with my song\\r alack what poverty my muse brings forth\\r that having such a scope to show her pride\\r the argument all bare is of more worth\\r than when it hath my added praise beside\\r o blame me not if i no more can write\\r look in your glass and there appears a face\\r that overgoes my blunt invention quite\\r dulling my lines and doing me disgrace\\r were it not sinful then striving to mend\\r to mar the subject that before was well\\r than of your graces and your gifts to tell\\r and more much more than in my verse can sit\\r your own glass shows you when you look in it\\r to me fair friend you never can be old\\r for as you were when first your eye i eyd\\r such seems your beauty still three winters cold\\r have from the forests shook three summers pride\\r three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd\\r three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd\\r since first i saw you fresh which yet are green\\r steal from his figure and no pace perceivd\\r so

still such and ever so\\r still constant in a wondrous excellence\\r therefore my verse to constancy confind\\r one thing expressing leaves out difference\\r fair kind and true is all my argument\\r fair kind and true varying to other words\\r and in this change is my invention spent\\r three themes in one which wondrous scope affords\\r fair kind and true have often livd alone\\r which three till now never kept seat in one\\r i see descriptions of the fairest wights\\r in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights\\r then in the blazon of sweet beautys best\\r of hand of foot of lip of eye

have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise\\r not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul\\r of the wide world dreaming on things to come\\r can yet the lease of my true love control\\r the mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd\\r and the sad augurs mock their own presage\\r incertainties now crown themselves assurd\\r and peace proclaims olives of endless age\\r now with the drops of this most balmy time\\r my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes\\r since spite of him ill live in this poor rime\\r while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes\\r and thou in this shalt find thy monument\\r when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent\\r whats in the brain that ink may character\\r which hath not figurd to thee my true spirit\\r whats new to speak what now to register\\r that may express my love or thy dear merit\\r nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine\\r counting no old thing old thou mine i thine\\r even as when first i hallowd thy fair name\\r so that eternal love in loves fresh case\\r finding the first conceit of love there bred\\r where time and outward form would show it dead\\r though absence seemd my flame to qualify\\r as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie\\r that is my home of love if i have rangd\\r just to the time not with the time exchangd\\r so that myself bring water for my stain\\r never believe though in my nature

what it works in like the dyers hand\\r whilst like a willing patient i will drink\\r potions of eisel gainst my strong infection\\r nor double penance to correct correction\\r pity me then dear friend and i assure ye\\r even that your pity is enough to cure me\\r your love and pity doth the impression fill\\r which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow\\r for what care i who calls me well or

well knows what with his gust is greeing\\r if it be poisond tis the lesser sin\\r that mine eye loves it and doth first begin\\r those lines that i before have writ do lie\\r even those that said i could not love you dearer\\r yet then my judgement knew no reason why\\r my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer\\r but reckoning time whose milliond accidents\\r creep in twixt vows and
